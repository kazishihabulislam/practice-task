         <p>The Liberation War of Bangladesh, also known as the Bangladesh Liberation War, was a pivotal conflict that led to the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971. The war was sparked by long-standing political, cultural, and economic grievances between the Bengali-speaking population of East Pakistan and the ruling government in West Pakistan. The tensions reached a climax when the Pakistani military launched a brutal crackdown on Bengali protesters on March 7, 1971, leading to widespread atrocities and the declaration of independence by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the Awami League, on March 26, 1971.</p>

            <p>Over the next nine months, the people of Bangladesh, supported by India and various international allies, engaged in a fierce struggle against the Pakistani military. The war was marked by significant resistance from the Mukti Bahini (freedom fighters) and a broad-based mass movement across the country. Despite severe hardships and heavy losses, the resilience of the Bangladeshi people and the strategic support provided by India were crucial in overcoming the Pakistani forces. The conflict saw massive human suffering, with reports of widespread human rights violations, including the genocide of civilians and rape.</p>
